# Best practices for article titles, meta titles, meta descriptions, and slugs in B2B copywriting

Well-crafted meta information can improve search engine rankings, enhance user experience, contribute to brand consistency, and boost social media engagement. Meta information encompasses visible content elements, such as article titles and URLs, and elements within the HTML code, like meta titles and meta descriptions. These components work collectively to describe the content for search engines and readers. This document is a guide to help you craft that information.

Unlike business-to-consumer (B2C) marketing, B2B writing is about building relationships and proving a product's return on investment for a business customer. When in the flow of your B2B writing, the hard work of your SEO analyst can get overlooked. **Process can help!** Rather than thinking only of the reader or only of the search engines, you should strive to tie all the threads together. The OSP writing workflow results in compelling content that uses strategic keywords to satisfy SEO, engage your readers, and implement your content strategy.
